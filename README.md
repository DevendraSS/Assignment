## Hypothesis on Loyal Customers' Behavior
### 1. Older Families (Budget Shoppers)
Reason for Loyalty: Older families typically have multiple members, including children and possibly elderly individuals. They seek cost-effective options, purchasing products in bulk to maximize savings. Product Preference: Large-sized snack packs or value-for-money deals to cater to household consumption. Shopping Habits: Regular, high-frequency purchases driven by household needs rather than impulse buying.

### 2. Retirees (Mainstream Shoppers)
Reason for Loyalty: Retirees often exhibit consistent shopping behaviors due to well-established preferences and routines. Their spending habits are stable, and they are less likely to switch brands frequently. Product Preference: Trusted, familiar brands that they have used for years. They may favor classic snack options over trendy or exotic flavors. Shopping Habits: Purchase for personal consumption or small social gatherings, leading to steady but predictable transaction patterns.

### 3. Young Singles/Couples (Mainstream Shoppers)
Reason for Loyalty: Young professionals and couples often have busy lifestyles and prefer convenient snack options. They are brand-conscious but look for a balance between affordability and quality. Product Preference: Smaller, on-the-go snack packs and trendy flavors that appeal to their experimental nature. Shopping Habits: Frequent but lower-quantity purchases, often influenced by promotions, advertisements, or peer recommendations.
